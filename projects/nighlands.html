									For this assignment we got to choose whatever genre we wanted, so we went for a top-down hack-n-slash game.

									The game was made in around 5 weeks, full time.<br>
									Our team consisted of 6 programmers, 2 level designers and 3 graphics artists.<br>
									My contribution was mainly to create the environment by implementing a procedural generation algorithm.<br>
									We decided to have the environment generated rather than being created by the level designers because it would give the game
									more replayability and to maintain the exploration aspect of the game.									
								</p>
								<p>
									The environment was built using a variety of 'modules' that were tilable, allowing for seamless connections.<br>
									Since each module had different heights, they had to be placed so that every module was accessable, so that the player could finish the level.
									This was achieved using Perlin-noise.<br>

									On generation, the path were traced from start to finish, and certain 'point of interest'-modules were placed along the path.
									This made sure that, for example, the Boss-levels were guaranteed to have a Boss-module.<br><br>
									Every level also had a 'Difficulty'-value, that increased for every level. This value determined how many hostile creatures would be on the map.
									Let's say that the first level had a difficulty-value = 1, then after the generation of the terrain, it would spawn a creature worth 1 'difficulty point'.
									While if the level would have a difficulty-value of for example 3, then the level could spawn with either 3 low-difficulty creatures or 1 high-difficulty creature.<br>
									This meant that the further you progressed, the more difficult the levels were.
