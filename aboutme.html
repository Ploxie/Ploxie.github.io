									<h2><a href="aboutme.html">About me</a></h2>
									<p>
									My name is Joakim Ekbladh and currently I live in Trelleborg, Sweden.<br>
									On my spare time I'm usually either playing online games with my friends or programming.<br>
									</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									I started learning how to program when I was around 12 years old when I tried to make a game using a simple RPG-maker.<br>
									There, they had a scripting language which I did not understand what so ever. Furtunately they had a forum with well written guides on the topic.
									So I spent many days trying to figure out how to implement the features I wanted, and when I finally achieved it, it was the best feeling in the world.<br>
									Ever since then I have been in love with programming.<br>
									At the time I was also playing a game called 'Runescape', which took a lot of time to progress on, so to be able to both play the game and code at the same time,
									I stared using a program that played the game for you.<br>
									The program used 'scripts' written in Java to tell the program what to do. And I immediately wanted to create my own script. So I started learning Java.<br>
									I worked on my script many hours a day for a few months, and finally released it to the public. I got a lot of positive feedback from the scripting community and the number of users grew up to 17 000 users, which made the script reach TOP 3 on most users in its category.<br>
								</p>
								<p>
									At that time I learned I could actually work as a Programmer, specifically Game Programmer, so I applied to The Game Assembly.
									It was very high pace and intense because I had to learn much in a short time, but I love to learn new things.<br>
									During my time there I had to create my own Game Engine in C++ using DirectX, which we later used for the Game Project assignments we got.<br>
									We made 8 Games in total, ranging from Text-Based-Adventure to First Person Shooters.
